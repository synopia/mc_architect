h1. Minecraft Architect

Minecraft Architect helps you building complex structures in "minecraft":http://www.minecraft.net.
As everyone familiar to the game knows, building interesting constructions like spheres, ellipses or arcs is a very
challenging task.

This tool will simplify the process by taking away the annoying counting blocks action. Instead, you will see your actual
construction sliced by levels and your current position in a running minecraft client.

h1. Scripting

<pre><code>
    # you have access to the following objects:
    #
    #  * @model
    #       full access to the world model (be careful...)
    #  * @world
    #       a "graphics" object, with some neat stuff like set_origin or ellipse
    #  * @slice_x, @slice_y, @slice_z
    #       works the same like @world, but with switched coordinate systems
    #       when you set a pixel using @slice_y.set_pixel(x,y,z,1), it will be placed at x,z,y in world coordinates
    #       y in world coordinate means up
    #  * @binvox
    #       experimental binvox loader
    #
    java_import "de.funky_clan.mc.config.DataValues"

    @mid_x = 1217
    @mid_y = 64
    @mid_z = -50

    # this method gets called to gather some info about this script
    def info
      {
        :name   => "Glaskugel",
        :author => "synopia",
        :mid    => [@mid_x, @mid_y, @mid_z]
      }
    end

    # this is called when "running" the script
    def run
      @world.set_origin @mid_x, @mid_y, @mid_z
      sphere @world, 63, DataValues::GLASS.id
    end

    # a simple sphere
    def sphere g, r, type
      (-r..+r).each do |x|
        (-r..+r).each do |y|
          (-r..+r).each do |z|
            dist = Math.sqrt( x**2 + y**2 + z**2 )
            if (r-dist).abs<0.5
              g.set_pixel x,y,z, type
            end
          end
        end
